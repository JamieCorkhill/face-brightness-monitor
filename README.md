# Face Detection & Monitor Brightness Adjustment

Monitors your webcam to determine when you've moved away from your screen for an exteneded period of time, and adjusts your monitor's brightness accordingly.

## Disclaimer

This software only works on Windows machines through Powershell since I don't have a Macintosh to test it on. The method by which the application detects your face could be easily improved, a better debounce time could be added, and a little bit more work could be done to reduce overhead through display capture.

You utilize this software at your own risk and hereby release any all concerned parties from liability for potential damages.
